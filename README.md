##Term I - Fundamentals

Learn to identify fundamental transaction types, build a web service and API, and secure digital assets with your blockchain identity. Create a private blockchain, and a notarization web service. Use your blockchain identity to secure digital assets on the Ethereum platform with a smart contract.

### Project 1: Manage Your Blockchain Identity

You will learn to create and manage your personal blockchain identity. You’ll get first hand experience generating wallet address and interacting with a web service to create your blockchain identity.


### Project 2: Building Your Own Private Blockchain

For this project, you’ll need to validate the blockchain dataset by converting the current validation functions with chain array to LevelDB. In the project boilerplate, the array needs to be replaced with LevelDB to persist the data. Functions that once worked with the array should now work with LevelDB.

### P3: RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework

This project introduces you to the fundamentals of web APIs with Node.js frameworks. Using your own private blockchain to create a web API is a huge first step toward developing your own web applications that are consumable by a variety of web clients. Later in this program, you’ll be programming blockchain technologies that utilize these similar features using smart contracts.

### P4: Build a Private Blockchain Notary Service

Your web service will provide a few new features to your users. The goal is to allow users to notarize star ownership using their blockchain identity. Below are the new features you will build into your application.

* Notarize - Users will be able to notarize star ownership using their blockchain identity.
* Verify Wallet Address	- Your application will provide a message to your user allowing them to verify their wallet address with a message signature.
* Register a Star	- Once a user verifies their wallet address, they have the right to register the star.
* Share a Story	- Once registered, each star has the ability to share a story.
* Star Lookup	- Users will be able to look up their star by hash, block height, or wallet address.
